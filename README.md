Solar System 3D Model
=========

This was my entry for the National Olympiad in Information Technologies 2013 in Bulgaria. 

Included in it are the source files and recources used.

A quick rundown of the main directory:

- Astronomy.exe: final version, requires the assets folder to be in the same directory
- assets: images, css and xml files which are used for planets' textures and formatting the lessons
- libs: the two libraries I use, Away3D for 3D modelling and Tweener for smooth animations
- com: the source code
